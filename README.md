Selenium/Python scripts

Repository that will hold all of my personal selenium projects. 

music.py:
This script allows the user to play a misical playlist on youtube without having to listen to a single ad. The user simply needs to put the songs they want to play in a file called "playlist.xlsx." The script will then pull these songs using the pandas python library and search for these songs on youtube. The script will mute/skip all ads, so the user never has to have their music interupted. The script will que the next song and skip its ad while the current song is playing to avoid and lull in music playback.
